# Wi-Fi Password Hack

This script automates the process of retrieving saved Wi-Fi passwords on a Windows machine and saves the information to a text file using Notepad++. 

---

## üìã **Description**
This VBScript performs the following steps:
1. Opens Command Prompt using simulated keystrokes.
2. Executes a `netsh` command to retrieve the Wi-Fi password for a specified network.
3. Copies the output to the clipboard.
4. Opens or creates a text file (`Wifi_info.txt`) in Notepad++.
5. Pastes the copied Wi-Fi information into the file.
6. Saves and closes the file.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Operating System:** Windows (Administrator privileges required)
- **Software Required:** 
  - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
  - Command Prompt with `netsh` support (available in Windows 7 and later)

---

### **Usage Instructions**
1. **Edit the Script**  
   Update the following line to match your target Wi-Fi network name:
   ```vb
   wifiName = "<Your_WiFi_Name_Here>"
   ```
2. **Run as Administrator**  
   - Right-click on the script and select **Run as Administrator**. This is required to access saved Wi-Fi passwords.
3. **Output**  
   - The Wi-Fi password will be saved in a file named `Wifi_info.txt` in the same directory as the script.

---

### **Example Command Used**
The script uses the following command to retrieve the Wi-Fi password:
```cmd
netsh wlan show profiles "<Your_WiFi_Name_Here>" key=clear | clip
```
- `netsh wlan show profiles` - Shows details about saved Wi-Fi profiles.
- `key=clear` - Displays the password in clear text.
- `| clip` - Copies the output to the clipboard.

---

### **Customization**
- Change the output file name by updating this line:
  ```vb
  notepadFileName = "Wifi_info.txt"
  ```
- If Notepad++ is not installed, you can modify the script to use the default Notepad by replacing:
  ```vb
  objShell.Run "notepad++.exe " & strFilePath
  ```
  with:
  ```vb
  objShell.Run "notepad.exe " & strFilePath
  ```
